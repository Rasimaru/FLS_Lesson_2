			<h1>Importance Of English Language In Information Technology</h1>
			<div>
				<p>
					While English is not the most spoken language globally, it is an official language in several countries.
					The
					estimated number of people who use English worldwide for regular communication is an estimated 2 Billion.
					English
					is also a dominant business language, and it is almost a necessity for one to penetrate the global
					markets.
				</p>

				<p>
					In some strange way, people unconsciously use English as a measure of intelligence in business circles. A
					strong
					vocabulary exudes intelligence and authority, but a technological or mathematical genius with poor
					diction
					might
					render himself unintelligent.
				</p>

		<h2>So why is English essential in Information Technology?</h2>
		<div id="section_1">
			<h3>1. Career Advancement</h3>
			<img src="img/1.jpg" alt="stairway to heaven =)" width="500">
			<p>
				Different studies across the globe show that people with English knowledge are likely to advance in their
				careers
				further. Studies have also shown that a more robust command of the English Language leads to higher pay. If
				you
				are like most people, you might have come across someone with a poor English language command. You may
				either
				have
				thought the person was rude or not very intelligent. However, this is sadly the state of affairs in
				information
				technology circles.
			</p>
			<p>
				Without English, you might find it difficult negotiating for better opportunities, stating expectations,
				describing previous job experiences, accomplishments, and other relevant skills.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section_2">
			<h3>2. Business Language</h3>
			<img src="img/2.webp" alt="lets make money $" width="500">
			<p>
				Information Technology is the backbone of the commercial world. On the other hand, English is the language
				of
				trade, and it, therefore, acts as a bridge between the Commercial world and information technology. Many
				programming languages are made in the US in English, or even if made in other countries, they are made in
				English
				to suit the global market. A good understanding of English is therefore essential if one is to understand
				these
				programs. It also allows for smooth communication while using the program and avoiding confusion.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section_3">
			<h3>3. Globalization</h3>
			<img src="img/3.jpeg" alt="" width="500">
			<p>
				Most IT companies recruit internationally, leading to people of many nationalities working in the same
				company.
				Other companies have discovered that they can lower tax obligations by setting up their companies overseas.
				This
				leads to a lot of outsourcing. Employees can also be brought on work visas to a country, and if they have
				not
				mastered the language, it may act as a barrier between them and a high-paying job. Language is, therefore,
				an
				excellent communication tool for working successfully in a company.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section_4">
			<h3>4. Access to Products</h3>
			<img src="img/4.png" alt="try it first" width="500">
			<p>
				The majority of the internet is in English, and therefore the access to products and services can be limited
				in
				IT
				if one does not correctly understand the language. Also, the majority of the websites were created by
				English
				speakers. The back end of the website and codes are either English words or their acronyms, making it easier
				for
				English speakers to understand.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section_5">
			<h3>5. Computer Processing Language</h3>
			<img src="img/5.jpg" alt="except 1C" width="500">
			<p>
				English is the primary IT language, and it has streamlined computer processing. Most programs are in English
				and
				might not respond to other programming languages if they were not programmed to understand the languages.
				Most
				programs are built with an English base and later upgraded to support other languages. If one wants to
				modify a
				program's speech at the base level, they need to understand English.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section_6">
			<h3>6. Learning IT</h3>
			<img src="img/6.jpg" alt="The newer the better" width="500">
			<p>
				The importance of the English language is not only seen in the IT workspace but also in school. To know
				English
				is
				paramount for every good IT specialist. Towards the end of the 1800s, the teaching philosophy took a radical
				shift
				seen even in modern-day schools. There were different methods such as Grammar Translation, Direct Method,
				and
				Audio methods. English facilitates the actual education structure allowing learning to take place in these
				institutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Multimedia presentations, cloud computing, video conferencing, and video editing are some ways Information
				Technology has revolutionized education. It is easier to grasp some of these concepts fundamentally when
				learning
				them in English.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section_7">
			<h3>7. Staying up to date with the latest trends</h3>
			<img src="img/7.jpg" alt="Infinite study" width="500">
			<p>
				In tech, staying up to date with the latest trends is required of you. However, without English knowledge,
				you
				have to wait for the content to be translated to your mother language before accessing it. This is one of
				the
				hurdles faced by most non-English speaking IT professionals. You will find yourself behind in information
				access,
				and by the time you access it, the information might not be relevant.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section_8">
			<h3>8. Managing global teams</h3>
			<img src="img/8.png" alt="" width="500">
			<p>
				If you are an IT manager managing global teams, you need a good grasp of the English language. Managing such
				a
				team is not a triviality. With a good command of the language, it will be easy to recognize and understand
				accents
				from different countries. Different words also have different connotations in various cultural norms. The
				best
				advice for you would be to over-communicate with the team, and this will keep both you and your team members
				in
				the same information loop.</p>

			<p>
				If you are not a native English speaker, this will improve your English and improve your team's
				communication
				and
				execution. Your development opportunities will be limitless.
			</p>

			<h3>Learning English</h3>
			<img src="img/9.webp"
				alt="https://www.topuniversities.com/sites/default/files/articles/lead-images/learn-english.jpg"
				width="500">
			<p>
				On the other hand, information technology has made it easy to learn English compared to earlier ages. It is
				easier
				now for students to learn English using technology. Many people learned English using IT products, surfing
				internet sites, recording and playback systems, and other educational broadcasting systems. Information
				Technology
				has transformed the world into a global village, making learning more accessible.
			</p>

			<p>
				As much as learning English can be challenging and time-consuming, it is valuable with very many
				accompanying
				opportunities. You can also hire an English essay writer with advanced skills to help make your learning
				more
				accessible and fun.
			</p>

			<p>
				In many countries where English is not widely spoken, you are considered very highly educated. <mark>
					English
					knowledge
					opens a lot of work opportunities both at home and abroad.</mark> The travel opportunities are limitless,
				and being a
				global citizen can fulfill these dreams for you. People in English-speaking countries complain about
				outsourcing,
				but it can be a lucrative opportunity for people in other countries. As you can see, English opens a lot of
				doors
				that would have otherwise remained closed.
